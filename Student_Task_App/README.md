# student_task_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.Student Task Tracker App (Real-Time with MongoDB Atlas)
🎯 Core Use Case
An admin (teacher) uploads students (via Excel or manually), assigns tasks to individual students, and
tracks their task progress. Each student sees only their tasks, completes them, and their report (with
performance graph) is updated in real-time.
👥 Roles
1. Admin (Teacher)
Upload student data via Excel or manually
Assign tasks to individual students
View and export task completion reports
Delete students
View top performers
Communicate with students (optional: messaging)
2. Student
Login with credentials provided by admin
View assigned tasks
Mark tasks as completed
See personal progress graph
📱 App Features
🔐 Authentication
Admin and student login
Student credentials generated by admin
Firebase Auth (optional) or JWT-based manual login
📥 Admin Panel Features (App/Web Flutter UI)
Upload Excel file to import students
Add/edit/delete student manually
Assign task to specific student(s)
View student-wise task reports with completion stats
View chart-based reports (Bar/Line graph)
Export student data and task reports
Delete student + tasks
View top-performing students
📤 Student Panel Features
Login with given ID/password
See own profile and assigned tasks
Mark task status: Pending → Completed
View progress report (Graph)
Task completion streaks (optional gamification)
🗃 Database Structure (MongoDB Atlas)
Collections:

✅ Conclusion
Yes, this app is very much feasible using Flutter + MongoDB Atlas, provided you build a middleware
backend to manage authentication, Excel file parsing, and access control. This architecture is scalable
and good for teaching real-world app development to your students.
Would you like me to generate a complete folder structure and API endpoints list to start
development right away?
No problem — let’s clarify this:
❓Can MongoDB Atlas work directly with Flutter?
Short answer:
❌ No, you cannot connect Flutter directly to MongoDB Atlas on the client side because:
MongoDB Atlas is a database, not an API.
It doesn't support direct public access from mobile apps due to security risks (like exposing
connection strings).
MongoDB requires server-side drivers (like Node.js, Python, etc.).
✅ Correct Way: Use a Backend between Flutter and MongoDB Atlas
You should follow this architecture:
scss
Flutter (Admin & Student Apps)
 ⇅
 REST API (Node.js + Express)
 ⇅
 MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database)
🔐 Why This Is Required:
MongoDB Atlas connection string contains database credentials — exposing this in a Flutter app
would be a huge security issue.
A backend allows you to:
Authenticate users (admin/student)
Control data access (role-based logic)
Handle Excel file uploads
Manage database logic safely
🛠 What You Need to Build:
Layer Tech Responsibility
Frontend Flutter (2 apps or roles) UI, user interaction
Backend Node.js + Express API endpoints, auth, logic, Excel import
Database MongoDB Atlas Store students, tasks, reports
🔁 Example API Flow
Action Flutter Request API (Node.js) Task
Admin login `POST /auth/login` Validate credentials, return JWT
Add student (Excel/manual) `POST /students/upload` Parse file, save students in MongoDB
Student login `POST /auth/login` Authenticate student
Get student tasks `GET /tasks/my` Return only their assigned tasks
Mark task as complete `POST /tasks/:id/done` Update task status in DB
Action Flutter Request API (Node.js) Task
Generate report `GET /reports/:id` Calculate completed vs pending tasks
Would you like me to give you:
1. ✅ A backend API template (Node.js + MongoDB Atlas)
2. ✅ A Flutter folder structure for Admin and Student roles
3. ✅ Sample API calling code in Flutter (`http` package)
Just let me know how you'd like to proceed
